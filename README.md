# 🚀 Kavishka's Portfolio Universe

> "Curiosity First. Code Second. Vibe Always."

Welcome to my digital playground! This isn't just a portfolio; it's an immersive experience designed to showcase not just *what* I do, but *how* I think. Built with modern web technologies.



## 🌌 The Vibe

The design philosophy here is simple: **Future-Ready & Human-Centric**.
-   **Neon & Glass**: A dark, sleek aesthetic with neon accents and glassmorphism for that premium feel.
-   **Interactive**: Everything reacts to you. Magnetic buttons, 3D backgrounds, and smooth animations.
-   **Alive**: It breathes. From the floating particles in the Hero section to the glowing cursor (coming soon!), the UI feels organic.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **3D Hero Section**: A mesmerising warp-speed starfield built with Three.js.
-   **Interactive Navigation**: Magnetic hover effects that feel satisfying to use.
-   **AI Chatbot**: A personal assistant to answer questions about my work.
-   **Admin Dashboard**: A hidden backend to manage projects and content dynamically.
-   **Project Management**: Drag-and-drop interface for organizing my work.
-   **Responsive Design**: Looks stunning on everything from a 4K monitor to a mobile phone.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This universe is powered by:

-   **Core**: [React 18](https://reactjs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (Fast, modern, reliable)
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Utility-first goodness)
-   **Animation**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (Smooth interactions)
-   **3D Graphics**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) + [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) (The magic sauce)
-   **Backend**: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Real-time data & Auth)
-   **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) (Clean & consistent)
